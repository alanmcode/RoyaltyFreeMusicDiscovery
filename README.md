# Royalty Free Music Discovery Application

This Project is an application that uses any commercial song name from Spotify to automatically find the most similar sounding royalty-free alternative through Spotify and Jamendo API endpoints through an algorithm to translate JSON responses into recognised inputs.

# Dependencies:
- Python 3.12
- pip install pyqt5
- pip install requests
- pip install python-dotenv

How to run:
- Execute the mainProject.py script. This can also be done through an IDE by running the project. The UI will open when successful

How to use:
- Input the name of both the song name and artist name, and click the Find Song button
- The application UI will update at the bottom with your recommended royalty-free song with the name of the song as well as a button to be redirected to the song's Jamendo page where you can play the track, view copyright details and download the song file.
